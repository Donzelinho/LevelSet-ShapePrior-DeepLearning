Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) can effectively extract the hidden patterns in images and learn realistic image priors from the training set. And fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the task of the image segmentation. However, these methods have the disadvantages of the noise, boundary roughness and no prior shape. Therefore, this paper proposes a level set with the deep prior method for the image segmentation based on the priors learned by FCNs from the training set. The output of the FCNs is treated as a probability map and the global affine transformation (GAT) is used to obtain the optimal affine transformation of the intrinsic prior shape at a specific image. And then, the level set method is used to integrate the information of the original image, the probability map and the corrected prior shape to achieve the image segmentation. Compared with the traditional level set method for images of simple scenes, the proposed method combines the traditional level set method with FCNs and corrected prior shape to solve the disadvantage of FCNs, making the level set method applicable to the image segmentation of complex scenes. Finally, a series of experiments with Portrait data set are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain more accurate segmentation results than the traditional FCNs.
