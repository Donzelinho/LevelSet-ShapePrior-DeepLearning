This paper proposes a novel level set segmentation method based on the priors learned by FCNs. The output of the FCNs is treated as a probability map to represent the probability of the target pattern. Based on the pattern prior learned from the training set by FCNs, the inherent prior shape is adjusted for the specific image. The proposed level set with the deep prior method can integrate the information of the original image, the probability map and the corrected prior shape for the image segmentation. Finally, through some experiments based on the Portrait data set, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional FCNs, the proposed method can obtain more accurate segmentation results.

In our future work, we will improve the GAT by the region-based method to find the local optimal affine transformation. Moreover,  we will construct the multi-objective matching method that enables the proposed method to handle more complex scenes and tasks.
