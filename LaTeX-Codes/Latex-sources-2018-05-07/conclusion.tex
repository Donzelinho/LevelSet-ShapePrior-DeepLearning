This paper proposes a novel Level Set segmentation method. Based on pattern prior learned from the training set by FCNs, the inherent prior shape is adjusted for the specific image. The proposed method can integrate the information of original image, the probability map and the corrected prior shape for segmentation. Finally, through some experiments based on Portrait data set, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified. And the experimental results show that the proposed method can solve FCNs' problems of noisy, imprecise and no shape prior.

In our future work, we will improve GAT by the region-based method, and find methods for local optimal affine transformation. Moreover,  we will construct the multi-objective matching method that enables the proposed method to handle more complex scenes and tasks.
