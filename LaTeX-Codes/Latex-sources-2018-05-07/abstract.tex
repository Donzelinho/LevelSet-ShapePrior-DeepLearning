Deep Convolutional Networks (DCNN) can effectively extract the hidden patterns in images and can learn realistic image priors from the training set. The trained depth model describes the prior probability of the target patterns. The output of FCNs is treated as a probability map in this paper and the Global Affine Transformation (GAT) is used for obtaining the optimal affine transformation of the intrinsic prior shape at a specific image. Finally, the Level Set method is used to integrate the information of the original image, the probability map and the corrected prior shape to achieve image segmentation. The proposed method can effectively combine the advantages of the three, and solves the disadvantages of FCNs¡® noise,  boundary roughness and no prior shape. The traditional Level Set method is suitable for the image of simple scenes, and the proposed method in this paper combines it with FCNs and shape prior to making it possible to be applied to image segmentation of complex scenes. Moreover, experimental results in Portrait data set show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
